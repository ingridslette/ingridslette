👩🏼‍💻 I'm a postdoc at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS).

🌎 I synthesize data in order to better understand impacts of global change on ecosystem functioning.

🌱 My PhD research focused on how previous climate extremes alter the impacts of extreme drought on root traits and patterns of aboveground vs. belowground plant production and carbon cycling in grasslands.

🎓 PhD Colorado State University, Ecology
