👩🏼‍💻 I'm a postdoc at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS).

🌎 I synthesize data in order to better understand how global change affects ecosystem functioning. Most of my research is related to precipitation change, plant production and carbon cycling.

🌱 My PhD research focused on how previous precipitation extremes alter the impacts of extreme drought on root traits and patterns of aboveground vs. belowground plant production and carbon cycling in grasslands.

🎓 PhD Colorado State University, Ecology

🎓 BS Hope College, Biology
