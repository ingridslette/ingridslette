## Hi there 👋 I'm Ingrid Slette


🔈 pronounced ing-rid sleh-tuh

😄 pronouns she/her

👩🏼‍💻 I'm a postdoc at the University of Minnesota, and I coordinate the NutNet and DragNet experiments.

🌎 I synthesize data in order to better understand how environmental changes affects ecosystem functioning.

🌏 My PhD research focused on how previous precipitation extremes alter the impacts of extreme drought on root traits and patterns of aboveground vs. belowground plant production and carbon cycling in grasslands.
