👩🏼‍💻 I'm a postdoc at the University of Minnesota, and I coordinate NutNet and DRAGNet. I'm also @nutnetadmin.

🌎 My research interests revolve around synthesizing data in order to better understand how various environmental changes affects ecosystem functioning.

☔️ My PhD research focused on how previous precipitation extremes alter the impacts of extreme drought on root traits and patterns of aboveground vs. belowground plant production and carbon cycling in grasslands.
