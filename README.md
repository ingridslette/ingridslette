## Hi there 👋 I'm Ingrid Slette


🔈 pronounced ing-rid sleh-tuh

😄 pronouns she/her

👩🏼‍💻 I'm a postdoc at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS).

🌎 I synthesize data in order to better understand how global change affects ecosystem functioning. Most of my research is related to precipitation change, plant production, and carbon cycling. 

🌍 Right now, I'm working on projects assessing changes in precipitation and production across US Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network sites, and comparing the impacts of naturally-occurring vs. experimentally-imposed droughts.

🌏 My PhD research focused on how previous precipitation extremes alter the impacts of extreme drought on root traits and patterns of aboveground vs. belowground plant production and carbon cycling in grasslands.
